# Coding_Task

You are given a list of integers, both positive and negative. Each integer in the list must either be paired with another 
element in the list or be a single element. Once the elements have been paired, the integers in the pairs are multiplied and 
the results are summed up - the sum will include the single elements.

Write a program to find the sequence of pairs and singles which give the biggest possible sum, and calculate this max sum.

Examples:
for the list [0,1,2,3,4,5] the pairs (4,5) and (2,3) are formed and 0 and 1 are single elements. The max. sum is 27 - (20+6+0+1).
for the list [-1,0,1] the pairs (-1,0) is formed and 1 is a single element. The max. sum is 1.
for the list [1,1] no pairs are formed only two single elements. The max. sum is 2. 

You choose how input/output is handled etc.

##Solution Check

You can open Google Chrome, go into Inspect element, and open Console. After that copy solution
from folder(GoodMonday_testSolution.js), paste into Console and press Enter.

After that on the next line into Console write this example and press Enter:

console.log(solve([1,2,3,4,-4, 0,5]));  - with this numbers we fill the Array list with data (Also can input random number, as you want)

After pressing Enter you will get the result of Exercise.
